This code creates a simple perceptron class with methods for prediction and training.
The 'predict' method calculates the output of the perceptron for a given input, and 
the 'train' method updates the weights of the perceptron based on the training data
using the perceptron learning rule. Finally, the example usage demonstrates training
the prediction on the OR logic function and making predictions with it.
